# Python Variable Annotations

This project focuses on Python variable annotations, type hints, and their usage in improving code readability and maintainability.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

1. Understand the concept of type annotations in Python 3
2. Use duck typing
3. Validate code using mypy

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or later
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
- All your modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- All your classes should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`)
- A documentation is not a simple word, it's a real sentence explaining what's the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)

## Tasks

0. Basic annotations - add
1. Basic annotations - concat
2. Basic annotations - floor
3. Basic annotations - to string
4. Define variables
5. Complex types - list of floats
6. Complex types - mixed list
7. Complex types - string and int/float to tuple
8. Complex types - functions
9. Let's duck type an iterable object
